# Opt Out Tools Machine Learning R&D Repository

Welcome to the **Opt Out Tools (OOT)** Machine Learning R&D repository. This
repository contains the research and the production code allowing us to build a
machine learning model for the automatic detection of online misogyny on Twitter.

A first version of this model is currently in use in the **Opt Out** [browser extension](https://github.com/opt-out-tools/opt-out).
The extension is currently itself in its alpha version and available for download
in the [Firefox add-ons library](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/opt-out-tools/).
A data statement of the dataset used for the first version of the model can be found
on **OOT's** [website](https://www.optoutools.com/tech).

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file in this repository to
know how you can contribute to it.

## Repository purpose

This repository has two purposes:

- Researching online misogyny automatic detection, i.e. exploring hate speech datasets and
experimenting with machine learning algorithms.
- Building a machine learning model for the browser extension based on our research.
